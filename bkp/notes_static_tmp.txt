	An IcoSphere is used as the second mesh for our implementation of CSG
	An IcoSphere  was used because it creates an even distribution of vertices on the sphere
	each of the IcoSphere’s faces are split into four  new faces to achieve a more detailed approximation of a sphere
	The IcoSphere’s center point is then set at  the current location of the controller
	. A Sphere is rendered  to visualise the current size of the IcoSphere for the user.
	The user has the choice of three operations with our implementation of Constructive Solid  Geometry (CSG).
	These are Union (two meshes are combined), Intersection (the section  which is part of both meshes ) and Difference (The part of mesh 1 that is not included in  mesh 2). 
	The operation has to be selected from a drop-down menu in the GUI window. 
	 results in a single mesh that contains the two parts of the input  meshes
	Finally, the resulting mesh is returned to the VR view, converted into a new Half-Edge Mesh  and displayed

	Numpy is a great framework, but it cannot utilize GPUs to accelerate its numerical computations
	A PyTorch Tensor is conceptually identical to a numpy array
	a Tensor is an n-dimensional array
	Tensors can keep track of a computational graph and gradients, but they抮e also useful as a generic tool for scientific computing.
	 PyTorch Tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations.

	Like the numpy example above we need to manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network:
	Princeton ModelNet project
	we hired human workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually decide whether each CAD model belongs to the specified cateogries
	Furthermore, we manually aligned the orientation of the CAD models for this 10-class subset as well. We provide both the 10-class subset and the full dataset for download.

	For several years, law enforcement and forensic experts have been surveying 
		crime scenes with 3D laser scanners.
	The resulting point cloud captures an incredible amount of detail. 
		But viewing a 3D model on screen doesn抰 really convey what it feels like at the scene

	one has to provide the this pointer of the instance and the method pointer
	a leading &-symbol followed by the class name,
	using the signal in exactly the same way as a function with an integer argument:
	one can detach a callback with cgv::base::disconnect according to
	all methods of the same instance attached to the signal as callback are detached as well.
	Callbacks to methods of instances or functors bear the danger that the instance to which the signal was connected is destructed before the signal is emitted. In this case the signal would call a method or the ()-operator with an invalid this pointer.
	The support for signals with boolean return values is provided by the cgv::base::bool_signal template.

	One final pitfall should be mentioned:
	when rebinding to a method m() which is implemented in a base class B of the class A, the this pointer of type A has to be cast to the base type B when used in the rebind method, i.e.

	users come from various backgrounds of engineering, science, and economics.
	They rewrote MATLAB in C and founded MathWorks in 1984 to continue its development.
	In 2000, MATLAB was rewritten to use a newer set of libraries for matrix manipulation, LAPACK.[23]
	in particular the teaching of linear algebra and numeric analysis
	LAPACK ("Linear Algebra Package") is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra.
	implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition.
	Details on this scheme can be found in the Naming scheme section in LAPACK Users' Guide.
	hese projects provide a similar functionality to LAPACK, but the main interface differs from that of LAPACK:
	Template metaprogramming
	templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled
	it builds expression trees at compile time and generates custom code to evaluate these.
	Eigen itself can provide BLAS and a subset of LAPACK interfaces.[3]
