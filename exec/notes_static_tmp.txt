	Here, we're saying we have a vertex function called "vertexFunction", and a fragment function called "fragmentFunction"".

	ZBrush is a digital sculpting tool that combines 3D/2.5D modeling, texturing and painting. 
	It uses a proprietary "pixol" technology which stores lighting, color, material, orientation, and depth information for the points making up all objects on the screen
	Our flagship product and the industry standard for 3D sculpting
	since we only supplied 3 colors, not the huge color palette we're seeing right now.
	 This is all the result of something called fragment interpolation in the fragment shader. 
	results in a lot more fragments than vertices originally specified. 
	 The rasterizer then determines the positions of each of those fragments based on where they reside on the triangle shape.
